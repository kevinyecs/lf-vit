## LF ViT Abstract

Transformers have been the dominant architecture for the last 7 years in the field of natural language processing due to their ability to scale with lot of data and learn complex relationships between individual tokens. In response the success of the architecture researchers quickly adapted the architecture into computer vision problems such as Vision Transformer (ViT) , Image Transformer. Main problem with the Transformer architecture lie in the attention mechanism it scales quadratically, therefore, it is not computationally efficient. Our proposal in this paper is to apply known attention alternatives in NLP, such as replacing Multi-head Attention with Fourier transform shown in the FNET .We are extending the architecture with Perceiver IO  style Latent vectors and Cross attention to not just make the component faster and computationally efficient 

## Vision Transformer - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy">Vision Transformer</a>, a simple way to achieve SOTA in vision classification with only a single transformer encoder, in Pytorch. Significance is further explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrdevFK_am4">Yannic Kilcher's</a> video. There's really not much to code here, but may as well lay it out for everyone so we expedite the attention revolution.

For a Pytorch implementation with pretrained models, please see Ross Wightman's repository <a href="https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models">here</a>.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install vit-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch import ViT

v = ViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

preds = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## Parameters

- `image_size`: int.  
Image size. If you have rectangular images, make sure your image size is the maximum of the width and height
- `patch_size`: int.  
Size of patches. `image_size` must be divisible by `patch_size`.  
The number of patches is: ` n = (image_size // patch_size) ** 2` and `n` **must be greater than 16**.
- `num_classes`: int.  
Number of classes to classify.
- `dim`: int.  
Last dimension of output tensor after linear transformation `nn.Linear(..., dim)`.
- `depth`: int.  
Number of Transformer blocks.
- `heads`: int.  
Number of heads in Multi-head Attention layer. 
- `mlp_dim`: int.  
Dimension of the MLP (FeedForward) layer. 
- `channels`: int, default `3`.  
Number of image's channels. 
- `dropout`: float between `[0, 1]`, default `0.`.  
Dropout rate. 
- `emb_dropout`: float between `[0, 1]`, default `0`.  
Embedding dropout rate.
- `pool`: string, either `cls` token pooling or `mean` pooling


## Simple ViT

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01580">An update</a> from some of the same authors of the original paper proposes simplifications to `ViT` that allows it to train faster and better.

Among these simplifications include 2d sinusoidal positional embedding, global average pooling (no CLS token), no dropout, batch sizes of 1024 rather than 4096, and use of RandAugment and MixUp augmentations. They also show that a simple linear at the end is not significantly worse than the original MLP head

You can use it by importing the `SimpleViT` as shown below

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch import SimpleViT

v = SimpleViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

preds = v(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## LF ViT

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06304">LF VIT description

You can use it as follows

```python
import torch
from vit_pytorch.na_vit import NaViT

v = NaViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1,
    token_dropout_prob = 0.1  # token dropout of 10% (keep 90% of tokens)
)

# 5 images of different resolutions - List[List[Tensor]]

# for now, you'll have to correctly place images in same batch element as to not exceed maximum allowed sequence length for self-attention w/ masking

images = [
    [torch.randn(3, 256, 256), torch.randn(3, 128, 128)],
    [torch.randn(3, 128, 256), torch.randn(3, 256, 128)],
    [torch.randn(3, 64, 256)]
]

preds = v(images) # (5, 1000) - 5, because 5 images of different resolution above

```

Or if you would rather that the framework auto group the images into variable lengthed sequences that do not exceed a certain max length

```python
images = [
    torch.randn(3, 256, 256),
    torch.randn(3, 128, 128),
    torch.randn(3, 128, 256),
    torch.randn(3, 256, 128),
    torch.randn(3, 64, 256)
]

preds = v(
    images,
    group_images = True,
    group_max_seq_len = 64
) # (5, 1000)
```
